Hi there,
I want to explain my codes, 
Firstly customtable-ignore-it folder is my previous try, but it's not working because of two reasons:
1: Resizing is not working properly.
2: Infinite scrolling uses tanstack/virtual, old react-virtual is no longer used and tanstack virtual has problems.
That's why i'm using a new table, but I wanted to show my old table and explain instead of deleting it.

* Ag-grid/community is not supporting ts types very well that's why i used "any"
* My table styles are not exactly the same as in the figma file because we can't change them, but in my previous table the styles are the same.


Thank you
Tuna
